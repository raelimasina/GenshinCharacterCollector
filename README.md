## Description
This web app is designed to let users keep track of their Genshin Character Collection without loading into the game. Upon load, the user can type in the first
name of the character they have added to their adventure team. That character will then be added to the collection, where users can see the character card and 
a bit of information about them.

Each user's collection will be saved to local storage.

### Languages
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

### Future Plans
- improve design
- develop back-end for user-based storage instead of systembased

### Sources
- Node.js API used for the tarot cards can be found here: https://genshin-api.netlify.app/api/
